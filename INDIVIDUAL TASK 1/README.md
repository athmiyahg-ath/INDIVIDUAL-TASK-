## 2. Animal Intelligence
Animal intelligence refers to cognitive abilities such as learning, communication, memory, and problem solving.

### Features
- Instinct-based behavior  
- Learning from environment  
- Communication through sounds and signals  
- Basic problem solving  

### Examples
- Dogs understanding commands  
- Dolphins showing social intelligence  
- Monkeys using tools  

### Advantages
- Fast survival adaptation  
- Strong sensory abilities  
- Learning through experience  

### Limitations
- Limited reasoning ability  
- Less creativity compared to humans  
- Mostly instinct-driven
